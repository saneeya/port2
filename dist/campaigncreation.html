                        <p class="lead mb-4 text-dark">Agency users wanted a faster, more flexible way to create ad campaigns—with features our tool didn't yet support.</p>
                        <p class="lead mb-4 text-dark">Over two years as the only designer on the project, I reimagined the campaign creation flow with new functionality, and cleaner layouts that streamlined the entire process and boosted revenue.</p>

                        <p class="lead mb-4">Disney Campaign Manager (formerly Hulu Ad Manager) launched in March 2020, allowing advertisers to create and manage their own ad campaigns on Hulu. Campaign creation included:</p>
                        <ul class="lead mb-4">
                            <li>Naming the campaign, setting its dates and budget</li>
                            <li>Targeting viewers based on demographics like age, location, interests, and content preferences</li>
                            <li>Uploading a video ad</li>
                            <li>Submitting the campaign for approval</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h2 class="mt-5 mb-4">Powering Up for Agencies: A UX Overhaul</h2>
                        <p class="lead mb-4">When we launched the platform, our main customers were small and medium-sized businesses. But over time, agency users became our main focus.</p>
                        <p class="lead mb-4">The team and I realized we needed to create a new campaign flow because:</p>
                        <ul class="lead mb-4">
                            <li>Agencies are more sophisticated users than SMBs and want more options in the platform such as more ad formats and more targeting options</li>
                            <li>We were going to rebuild the whole platform to be in-house (currently managed by a 3rd party agency since launch), giving me the opportunity to redo the UX</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="mt-4 mb-3">Why do we want agency users?</h3>
                        <ul class="lead mb-4">
                            <li>Agencies bring in more revenue than SMBs</li>
                            <li>Business goals changing to better suit the needs of agency users</li>
                            <li>Achieving more parity with the options offered to advertisers in the direct (non-self-serve) side of the company</li>
                            <li>Become more inline with competitors</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h2 class="mt-5 mb-4">What Agencies Really Want</h2>
                        <p class="lead mb-4">Agency users have different needs than our usual customers, so we had to add new features to support them.</p>
                        <p class="lead mb-4">Below is a list of those user needs, along with a brief description of each.</p>
                        <h3 class="mt-4 mb-3">Add Line Items</h3>
                        <p class="lead mb-4">A line item is a single set of targeting, budget, dates, creative assets, etc.</p>
                        <p class="lead mb-4">In the current platform: <strong>1 campaign = 1 line item</strong></p>
                        <p class="lead mb-4">In the new flow: <strong>1 campaign = multiple line items</strong></p>
                        <p class="lead mb-4">Having many line items is useful for agency users since they usually run multiple sets of targeting/creatives under the same brand.</p>
                        <h3 class="mt-4 mb-3">More Targeting Options</h3>
                        <p class="lead mb-4">Agency users want more options for targeting to let them better reach their clients' customer base. Such as:</p>
                        <ul class="lead mb-4">
                            <li><strong>Dayparting:</strong> The ability to choose the schedule of days and times when the ad should run and should not run</li>
                            <li><strong>Frequency:</strong> How often an ad should air</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="mt-4 mb-3">Add VAST Tags</h3>
                        <p class="lead mb-4">A VAST (video ad serving template) tag is a string of code that is configured in a 3rd party application that includes:</p>
                        <ul class="lead mb-4">
                            <li>Video ads with different content and/or different audio/video quality</li>
                            <li>Tracking pixels or 3rd party tags to count number of views (or impressions)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="lead mb-4">VAST was already available on the direct (non-self-serve) side of the business and was a common request from agency users.</p>
                        <h2 class="mt-5 mb-4">UX Showdown: Single Page or Step-by-Step?</h2>
                        <p class="lead mb-4">A previous designer explored a new single-page campaign design (shown here) and tested how it performed compared to the existing multi-page layout.</p>
                        <p class="lead mb-4">Here were the main results from the sessions:</p>
                        <ul class="lead mb-4">
                            <li>Half of the users (3 out of 6) preferred the single-page flow.</li>
                            <li>Many felt the single-page flow lacked clear step-by-step structure.</li>
                            <li>Users liked the progress bar in the page-by-page flow because it showed where they were in the process.</li>
                            <li>Users appreciated seeing all the steps at once in the single-page flow's navigation bar.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h2 class="mt-5 mb-4">Why Single Page Wins</h2>
                        <p class="lead mb-4">Based on past designs and research, I chose the single-page layout. It's easier to navigate with new features and scaleable for future updates.</p>
                        <p class="lead mb-4">Below are competitor examples I reviewed, focusing on user flows and how they handle multiple line items.</p>
                        <h2 class="mt-5 mb-4">The Iterative Journey</h2>
                        <p class="lead mb-4">A major change in the new campaign flow was the implementation of line items. A line item is a single set of targeting, budget, dates, creative assets, etc.</p>
                        <p class="lead mb-4">I started exploration by having a tab for each line item on the top rail.</p>
                        <p class="lead mb-4">The tab layout wasn't scalable for campaigns with multiple line items, so I transitioned to a side panel navigation instead.</p>
                        <p class="lead mb-4">Scroll through designs below to view my explorations.</p>
                        <p class="lead mb-4">Once the navigation was set, I added new content, including a section for dayparting, pacing, and frequency settings.</p>
                        <p class="lead mb-4">I called this section "Delivery" since all three relate to how often an ad runs.</p>
                        <p class="lead mb-4">In the Ad Upload section, I designed a new flow for VAST, allowing users to input and upload VAST code and preview their creative assets.</p>
                        <p class="lead mb-4">The challenge was figuring out how to display multiple assets in the modal and clearly show whether each asset was accepted, rejected (with error details), or still pending review.</p>
                        <p class="lead mb-4">I explored several VAST layout options (viewable in the carousel below) and ultimately decided to show only the attributes that failed validation, instead of displaying a pass/fail status for each asset.</p>
                        <h2 class="mt-5 mb-4">The Final Design in Action</h2>
                        <p class="lead mb-4">Below is the prototype of the new campaign creation process.</p>
                        <h2 class="mt-5 mb-4">Putting the Campaign Flow to the Test</h2>
                        <p class="lead mb-4">Due to other commitments, user testing began later than planned—but I took the initiative to move it forward. While I couldn't test every feature (like VAST), I focused on the core campaign creation flow.</p>
                        <p class="lead mb-4">Specifically, I tested whether users could:</p>
                        <ul class="lead mb-4">
                            <li>Create a campaign</li>
                            <li>Add a new line item</li>
                            <li>Select targeting options</li>
                            <li>Review and submit a line item</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="lead mb-4">With no dedicated research team, I recruited non-user advertisers and conducted moderated usability sessions to gather valuable feedback.</p>
                        <h3 class="mt-4 mb-3">Usability Test Overview</h3>
                        <p class="lead mb-4"><strong>Goals</strong></p>
                        <ul class="lead mb-4">
                            <li>Evaluate whether the new campaign creation flow improves the user experience</li>
                            <li>Assess ease of understanding and overall usability</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="lead mb-4"><strong>Participants</strong></p>
                        <ul class="lead mb-4">
                            <li>10 individuals with experience running online ad campaigns</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="lead mb-4"><strong>Method</strong></p>
                        <ul class="lead mb-4">
                            <li>1-hour moderated usability sessions</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="lead mb-4">Users provided a range of feedback during the testing sessions—covering both usability across different flows and visual design. Below is a summary of the key insights I gathered.</p>
                        <h2 class="mt-5 mb-4">Testing Takeaways: Usability & Design</h2>
                        <h3 class="mt-4 mb-3">Overall Line Item Flow</h3>
                        <p class="lead mb-4">Users appreciated the single-page flow for setting up line item details, but 66% of them struggled to locate the "New Line Item" button when prompted—it wasn't immediately discoverable.</p>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote mb-4">
                            <p class="mb-0">"I just found this whole process just very smooth and clear"</p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote mb-4">
                            <p class="mb-0">"This was really clean, easy, and way better than Meta"</p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <h3 class="mt-4 mb-3">Impression Delivery</h3>
                        <p class="lead mb-4">There was confusion around how impressions were estimated, particularly within the custom pacing settings. Some users expressed concern about how their campaign budget would impact impression delivery.</p>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote mb-4">
                            <p class="mb-0">"If the ad was doing well…am I going to burn through my budget sooner?"</p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote mb-4">
                            <p class="mb-0">"How are we arriving at the 28,000 impressions for a $1,000 budget?"</p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <h3 class="mt-4 mb-3">"Line Item"</h3>
                        <p class="lead mb-4">The term "Line Item" confused some users. Even those familiar with the concept typically encountered it as "flights" or "ad groups" on other platforms.</p>
                        <h3 class="mt-4 mb-3">Look and Feel</h3>
                        <p class="lead mb-4">While most of them were able to navigate easily. a couple users commented on the UI feeling "too simple" or "quite plain" and noting it lacked personality.</p>
                        <h2 class="mt-5 mb-4">The Road Ahead: Enhancements</h2>
                        <p class="lead mb-4">The new Campaign Creation flow launched in October 2024. While the launch faced some technical issues and bugs, I had thoroughly QA'd the experience beforehand—flagging usability problems and correcting UI inconsistencies early on.</p>
                        <p class="lead mb-4">Since then, we've introduced several key features, including support for Disney+, Hulu, or both as ad destinations, and the integration of VAST tags. Ongoing efforts include collecting feedback from advertisers and internal teams, and iterating on designs to address issues uncovered in user testing.</p>
                        <p class="lead mb-4">We're also undergoing a major visual update as part of the rebrand from <em>Hulu Ad Manager</em> to <em>Disney Campaign Manager</em>, which involves a complete overhaul of the platform's style guide.</p>
                        <h2 class="mt-5 mb-4">Designing Through Constraints: What I Learned</h2>
                        <p class="lead mb-4">Campaign Creation is still evolving, with many new features on the roadmap. As the platform grows, we may eventually need to revisit and redesign the flow to accommodate future updates.</p>
                        <p class="lead mb-4">This project came with its share of challenges—working as the sole designer, without a dedicated research team, and collaborating with overseas developers across time zones, all while juggling other responsibilities. Despite that, it was a rewarding experience to lead the design of a core flow from the ground up and contribute meaningfully to the platform's growth</p>
                        <h3 class="mt-4 mb-3">Things I Learned</h3>
                        <ul class="lead mb-4">
                            <li>What other people in the team did, specifically ones I otherwise might not interact with such as sales & customer support</li>
                            <li>How to onboard and train new designers when I was able to get a contractor to help me closer to the product launch</li>
                            <li>Working with international developers in different time zones also taught me to present design flows as clearly and simply as possible to reduce back-and-forth communication</li>
