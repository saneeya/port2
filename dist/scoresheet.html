                        <p class="lead mb-4 text-dark">Teachers needed a faster way to enter test scores for their whole class instead of updating each student individually.</p>
                        <p class="lead mb-4 text-dark">
                            I designed the

                        <p class="lead mb-4">At McGraw Hill Education, the platform included a scoresheet feature that automatically graded online quizzes, tests, and homework.</p>
                        <figure class="mt-3 mb-5">
                            <a class="custom-lightbox-trigger" href="#" data-image="assets/img/portfolio/class_scoresheet.png" data-title="Class scoresheet interface"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/portfolio/class_scoresheet.png" alt="Class scoresheet interface" style="cursor: pointer" /></a>

                        </figure>
                        <p class="lead mb-4">While this worked well for older students, it posed a challenge for K5 teachers. Many of them used the platform to create tests/quizzes and printed them out for children to take by hand. They auto-grading feature wasn't something they could do.</p>
                        <figure class="mt-3 mb-5">
                            <a class="custom-lightbox-trigger" href="#" data-image="assets/img/portfolio/class_taking_test.png" data-title="Class taking test"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/portfolio/class_taking_test.png" alt="Class taking test" style="cursor: pointer; max-width: 60%; margin: 0 auto; display: block" /></a>

                        </figure>
                        <p class="lead mb-4">After collecting the completed assignments, teachers had to manually input scores into the scoresheet to access platform-generated reports. Without doing this, they couldn't view performance data or identify areas for remediation.</p>
                        <p class="lead mb-5">The process was lengthy—teachers had to enter scores for each question, for every student—which made it time-consuming and cumbersome.</p>

                        <h2 class="mt-5 mb-4">Simplifying Bulk Scoring</h2>
                        <p class="lead mb-4">I knew a new design was needed—one that retained the core features of the individual scoresheet but scaled for class-wide use. This led to the concept of the Class Scoresheet.</p>
                        <p class="lead mb-4">I began with low-fidelity wireframes, focusing on simplifying score entry across a full class. One key stakeholder request was an "Apply All" feature, allowing teachers to assign the same score to all students for a single question. My initial design approach drew inspiration from a spreadsheet-style layout, similar to Excel, to make bulk scoring intuitive and familiar.</p>
                        <p class="lead mb-4">The spreadsheet view offered a quick overview of the entire class, making it easy to scan and compare scores. However, with a large number of students or questions, it could became overwhelming and hard to navigate.</p>
                        <p class="lead mb-4">To address this, I created an alternative design focused on the individual student. This view allowed teachers to enter scores one student at a time</p>
                        <p class="lead mb-5">Both designs had merit, and stakeholders agreed there wasn't a clear winner upfront. We decided to test both the class-level spreadsheet view and the individual student view to better understand which approach teachers preferred in real-world scenarios.</p>
                        <h2 class="mt-5 mb-4">User Testing: Fixing the Score Entry Struggle</h2>
                        <h3 class="mt-4 mb-3">Pilot Test</h3>
                        <p class="lead mb-4">Before starting formal user testing, our research team conducted a pilot session with a K5 teacher. While observing, I noticed a major design issue with the spreadsheet view: the participant struggled to input scores question-by-question within the columns.</p>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote mb-4"><p class="mb-0">"It would be nice if it [the design] was going down vertically here as well, instead of horizontally, it would just looking up and down on here. It's almost harder for me to go up and down and then track horizontally."</p></blockquote>
                        <p class="lead mb-5">Teachers grading paper assignments typically work student-by-student rather than question-by-question. The original spreadsheet design conflicted with this mental workflow, so the participant preferred the second, individual-student-focused design.</p>
                        <p class="lead mb-5">Based on this insight, I revised the designs to place the questions in a fixed left-side column, with student names displayed across the top.</p>
                        <h3 class="mt-4 mb-3">User Testing</h3>
                        <p class="lead mb-4">Our research team recruited seven K5 instructors who had experience with two of our major K5 products, Reading Mastery and Reading Wonders. All were familiar with the existing online scoresheet.</p>
                        <p class="lead mb-4">We presented both the spreadsheet design (Design A) and the student-by-student design (Design B).</p>
                        <h4 class="mt-4 mb-3">How we made User Testing more "real"</h4>
                        <p class="lead mb-4">To simulate how teachers grade printed assignments, we provided participants with PDFs of three scored tests.</p>
                        <p class="lead mb-5">We asked them to have the PDFs open on a second screen—or printed out—so they could reference them while entering scores for the first three student</p>
                        <h2 class="mt-5 mb-4">What did Teachers Think?</h2>
                        <h3 class="mt-4 mb-3">Spreadsheet Design (Design A)</h3>
                        <ul class="lead mb-4">
                            <li>Many participants appreciated being able to use keyboard shortcuts like Tab and Enter to quickly input scores. However, a few didn't realize those shortcuts were available, highlighting a need for better affordance or guidance.</li>
                            <li>While Design A performed well overall, feedback on the "Submit Assignment" button was mixed. Some liked the ability to submit all students at once, but all participants emphasized the need for a way to exclude students who were absent or excused.</li>
                            <li>One feature that consistently missed the mark was the "Apply" button, which automatically gave a student full credit for all questions. Participants liked the functionality once it was explained, but the button itself was not intuitive, suggesting the need for clearer labeling or onboarding.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p class="lead mb-4">However, there were some trade-offs:</p>

                            <li>Several noted that since graded assignments are rarely in alphabetical order, they would need to scroll back and forth frequently to match names, which could slow them down.</li>

                        <p class="lead mb-4">Out of 7 participants, 5 preferred Design A and 2 preferred Design B. When asked how the designs could be improved, participants suggested:</p>
                        <ul class="lead mb-4">
                            <li>The ability to mark students as absent or exempt</li>
                            <li>Displaying overall scores or averages</li>
                            <li>Using color coding to highlight high and low scores</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p class="lead mb-4">Based on the feedback, I decided to move forward with Design A and made the following changes:</p>
                        <ul class="lead mb-4">
                            <li>Renamed and styled the "Apply" button for clarity</li>
                            <li>Added an info icon to explain keyboard shortcuts</li>
                            <li>Allowed teachers to exclude students from submission</li>
                            <li>Changed "Submit Assignment" to "Submit Scores"</li>
                            <li>Added indicators showing which scores were submitted</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="lead mb-4">After more revisions, these final changes were made:</p>
                        <ul class="lead mb-5">
                            <li>Changed the "Submit Scores" modal to let teachers select which students to submit, rather than selecting all by default</li>
                            <li>Added support for multiple attempts, showing each time a student retakes an assignment (a late-stage stakeholder request)</li>
                            <li>Updated the scoresheet layout to clearly display and manage multiple attempts</li>

                        <p class="lead mb-4">One of the most surprising takeaways from this project was how excited users were about the prototype. I hadn't fully realized how frustrating the current process was for them, and it was rewarding to see how the new design helped ease that pain.</p>
                        <p class="lead mb-4">Here are a few things users said during testing:</p>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote mb-4">
